# CEMS Core Platform: firmware structure, scan contract and integration rules

Rev A, 19 Oct 2026. Implements the "Firmware architecture and toolchain" section of
*CEMS Supervisor Design Specification Rev 1.00* (file name: *CEMS Instrument Core
Platform Design Specification Rev 1.00.pdf*). This is the code that every instrument
in the family shares. The VM/MUX program translated in `Existing Design/Analysis/stage4`
runs on top of it.

Not in this revision (next modules, in the order proposed): shared parameter table and
FRAM store; Modbus TCP; HTTP/JSON; logger; EVE driver and UI; firmware update/bootloader.

## 2. Tasks and priorities

Priorities follow the design spec: control first, then the parameter store and logger,
then networking, and the UI last. Nothing below the scan can delay it.

| Task | FreeRTOS prio | Runs | Watchdog silence limit | Body |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ctrl | 14 | every 1 ms (`PLAT_CTRL_PERIOD_MS`) | 50 ms | `plat_ctrl_tick()`, fast control loops (weak, empty for now) |
| scan | 13 | every 10 ms (`PLAT_SCAN_PERIOD_MS`) | 200 ms | `scan_step()`: the VM/MUX program |
| supervisor | 12 | every 100 ms | n/a | kicks the IWDG only if every task is alive |
| FreeRTOS timer service | 11 | on demand | n/a | kernel |
| store | 10 | event-driven | 2 s | `plat_store_task_body()` (next module) |
| lwIP tcpip_thread | 8 | event-driven | via modbus/http | lwIP |
| modbus | 7 | socket events | 5 s | `plat_modbus_task_body()` |
| http | 6 | socket events | 5 s | `plat_http_task_body()` |
| ui | 3 | touch/redraw | 5 s | `plat_ui_task_body()` |

Every service body is a weak default that only checks in. A module replaces it by
defining a function with the same name, so adding Modbus later doesn't touch this file.

**Watchdog policy.** Each task calls `plat_checkin()` from its loop. If any task stays
silent past its limit, the supervisor records the task's name in `plat_diag`, sets the
outputs to their safe state, and resets the unit. If the supervisor itself is starved
(a higher-priority task stuck in a loop), nothing kicks the IWDG and the hardware resets
the unit about 1 s later. After either reset, `plat_diag` tells the next boot what happened.

## 3. The scan contract (for the application)

One `scan_step()` is one UniLogic scan (11_UniLogic_Semantics E1, E10, E11):

1. `g_dt_ms` = ms since the previous scan started, **measured**. It is 0 on the first scan. A late scan reports the real gap, so timers never lose time.
2. `RTC_Date` / `RTC_Time` = one clock snapshot for the whole scan. `Day_Of_Week` uses UniLogic's convention (1 = Sunday); the STM32 RTC uses 1 = Monday, and the conversion is tested for all 7 days. If the RTC is invalid, the previous snapshot is kept and the scan counts it.
3. Inputs: `bsp_io_read()` fills a `plat_io_in_t`, then `app->io_in()` maps it onto application tags (`TA30_DI[]`, `UID_DI[]` …). Inputs stay frozen for the whole scan.
4. External writes: up to 16 queued commands (from UI, web or Modbus) go through `app->apply_cmd()`. The logic never sees a value change half way through a scan.
5. Logic: `Ladder_Initial_Cycle` is true for the first scan only, then `app->logic()` runs (that is `Function1`).
6. Outputs: the image starts **all off**, `app->io_out()` sets what it drives, and then `bsp_io_write()` runs. An unmapped output can never be left on.
7. Publish: `app->publish()` copies display values into the application's snapshot, inside the seqlock.
8. Statistics: scan count, late starts, max `g_dt_ms`, execution time (from the DWT cycle counter) and overruns.

The application provides one `scan_app_t` (see `app_demo/app_demo.c`) and calls
`plat_start(&app)` from `main()`. That is the whole interface.

**Timer timing note.** A TON that starts in a scan is credited with that scan's
`g_dt_ms`, so it can end up to one scan period early (the demo shows 1990 ms for a
2000 ms preset). Every scan-based PLC behaves this way. The application's timer model
(assumption A4.10) keeps responsibility for matching UniLogic.

## 4. Integration rules for the application (VM/MUX) code

These come from reading the Stage 4 sources against this platform. **Items 1 and 2
stop the Stage 4 chunks from linking together correctly**, so they need fixing in that
work before integration.

1. **One definition of the system tags.** `g_dt_ms` is defined in `4G_faithful.c`, `4H_faithful.c` and `4I_faithful.c`, and 4H also defines `Ladder_Initial_Cycle` and `RTC_Date`. Linked together, that is a multiple-definition error. On the platform, `scan_engine.c` owns all four. The faithful files should only declare them, via `#include "ul_system.h"`. The test files can keep their own definitions.
2. **`rtc_date_t` layout differs.** `4F2.h` declares `{ Year, Month, Day_In_Month, Day_Of_Week }`, while `4E.h` and `4H.h` declare `{ Day_Of_Week, Day_In_Month, Month, Year }`. Two different layouts of one global in one program is undefined behaviour: dates would be silently wrong. Every chunk should use the typedef in `ul_system.h`. Members are accessed by name, so only the typedef lines change.
3. `ul_timer_t` is repeated in every chunk header. Use the one in `ul_system.h`, which has the same layout.
4. `Touched_Bit` and `VNC_Touched_Bit` (General.* HMI bits, used in 4F4) will be supplied by the UI module. Until then, the application should define them itself.
5. Physical I/O tags (`TA30_DI[]`, `UID_DO[]` …) remain application tags. The platform hands over channel images, and `io_in`/`io_out` do the mapping. Channel numbers follow `10_IO_Map.md`.
6. The application must not call the BSP or FreeRTOS directly. Anything it needs from the platform comes through `scan_app_t` or `ul_system.h`.

## 5. How it was checked

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Host unit tests (`make test`): scan order, first-scan bit, dt including 2^32 wrap and late scans, RTC snapshot and all 7 weekday conversions, frozen inputs, outputs default off, command order/limit/reject, seqlock retry and bounded failure, monitor grace/limits/wrap/re-enable, diag record across warm reset and after corruption | 161 checks, 0 failures, gcc -Werror with AddressSanitizer and UBSan |
| PC simulation (`make sim`): demo app, DI timeline, a web write, a late scan | Timer fires on time across the late scan; the write lands on the next scan |
| FreeRTOS POSIX run of the real task file (`make rtos`) | 280 scans in 2.8 s, ctrl 1 kHz, IWDG kicked every 100 ms; a UI task that hangs at 2 s gives a recorded "ui" fault, outputs to safe state, and a reset at 7.0 s |
| Target compile and link (`make target`, `make -f port/stm32h5/check.mk link`) with arm-none-eabi-gcc 13.3.1, FreeRTOS V11.2.0, STM32H5 HAL and CMSIS from ST's GitHub | Clean with -Werror. ELF: 12.8 KB flash, 89 KB RAM (48 KB FreeRTOS heap + 39 KB stacks). `plat_diag` is in the NOLOAD `.noinit` section. SVC, PendSV and SysTick come from the FreeRTOS port |
| On the STM32H573I-DK | **Not done yet.** Needs the CubeIDE project (`docs/CUBEMX_SETUP.md`) |

## 6. Decisions needed

| # | Decision | Proposal | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Scan period | 10 ms, fixed period, measured `g_dt_ms` | The UniLogic scan time is unknown. 10 ms matches the Stage 4 tests and leaves the CPU mostly free |
| D2 | Fast control loop rate | 1 kHz task tick for now; a hardware timer ISR if any loop needs more | The spec allows 1 to 10 kHz; the loop list doesn't exist yet |
| D3 | Network stack | lwIP 2.2.1 from ST's `stm32h5-classic-coremw-apps`, added by hand | CubeMX doesn't offer lwIP for the H5 (ST recommends NetX Duo). The spec says lwIP; NetX Duo is ThreadX-based, and choosing it would mean changing the RTOS |
| D4 | Hard-fault handling | Record PC/LR in `plat_diag`, then reset | Not written yet; small, belongs in the port |
